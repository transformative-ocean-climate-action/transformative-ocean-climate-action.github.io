Ocean and Society, 2, Article 8924. https://doi.org/10.17645/oas.8924\n\n\nAbstract\nIn recent years, ocean governance has called for strategic action and science‐informed policy to work towards the sustainable development of the ocean, most notably as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030). This common framework identifies the integration of scientific knowledge in governance as a key process to deliver solutions responding to the current challenges, opportunities, and transformations posed by global change in the oceans. This article presents a methodological approach for identifying ocean‐related research outputs and documenting research‐based knowledge integration in documents that inform ocean governance. Specifically, this study builds on an analysis of the references included in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment report to (a) identify and describe the research outputs cited in the distinct chapters of the report, (b) identify research outputs relevant to ocean governance through the analysis of citations from and to references included in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment, (c) compare both datasets to examine the position of the literature cited in the report within a broader ecosystem of ocean‐related research, and (d) present a method to identify topically relevant research that could be integrated in future ocean assessments. Our findings show distinct referencing practices across chapters and expert groups and a higher reliance on high‐profile sources in the report compared to a broader dataset of ocean research outputs. Moreover, this study highlights an innovative approach to identifying ocean research based on knowledge syntheses and considers discussion points about integrating research‐based knowledge in documents informing ocean governance.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

Reversing the decline of ocean health and taking meaningful action on climate change requires empowering all stakeholders and rightsholders – including youth – to help develop and implement adaptative solutions. Our cluster approaches this issue from an informational justice perspective, emphasizing the right by all to access information and knowledge, have equal opportunity to directly participate in the production and dissemination of information and knowledge, and have their identities and culture be recognized, respected, and fairly represented in the informational world. Guided by this framework, our research addresses the fundamental question: How can we improve knowledge production, exchange, and use among diverse actors to build an understanding of ocean and climate change that enables societal mobilization towards a sustainable future?"

    "text": "Dalhousie University’s Ocean Frontier Institute launched the Transforming Climate Action (TCA) research program in 2023. Philippe Mongeon, one of the leads of Cluster 3.2, and members of the QSSLab will be involved in four work packages, in collaboration with Dalhousie’s Faculty of Computer Science and the Université du Québec à Rimouski.\nWork Package 1: Oceans and climate: identifying knowledge and its structure\nThis work package has two main objectives: to identify scholarly literature on the role of oceans in relation to climate and to analyze the structure and evolution of this research over time using research clusters. It aims to build a global overview of ocean-climate research, supporting both internal projects and informing broader climate policy, like the IPCC reports. Through hierarchical clustering and machine learning, the project will classify knowledge within this corpus, creating tools for future research. Collaboration between Dalhousie University’s Information Science and Computer Science faculties will help ensure the development of a robust knowledge navigation and classification system.\nWork Package 2: The evolution of scholarly and public attention toward ocean-climate research\nThis work package builds on WP1 by examining how ocean-climate research is mobilized across different platforms, including scientific literature, social media, news, policy, and educational materials. Its aim is to determine who engages with this knowledge, the contexts of its citations, and how different geographical or topical clusters generate attention. By mapping knowledge flows, this study will identify which research is visible to key organizations like NGOs and explore how knowledge is disseminated across different audiences. The project will also develop visualization tools to track the movement of knowledge and provide insights into how external events, such as COVID-19, affect knowledge structures, feeding into WP3’s analysis of the drivers of knowledge dissemination.\nWork Package 3: The shaping of the ocean-climate research landscape\nWork Package 3 focuses on understanding the evolution of ocean-climate research by analyzing knowledge flows over time, using bibliometrics and generative AI. It aims to identify how world events, political actions, and social shifts impact the production and dissemination of research, while also exploring hidden causalities in the knowledge landscape. The project will develop tools to assess gaps in the current knowledge base, predict future research directions, and generate targeted actions to address under-explored areas, with an emphasis on equity and inclusion. Generative AI will also be leveraged to hypothesize future knowledge flows, shape research initiatives, and support multi-language accessibility.\nWork Package 4: Mapping curriculum and the scientific landscape\nThis work package builds on previous efforts to connect ocean and climate science with educational syllabi, focusing on Atlantic Canadian secondary and post-secondary educators. The project aims to analyze the gap between scientific literature and its representation in regional curricula, understand who is and isn’t represented in the scientific works used in education, and develop tools that help educators access relevant research. Through bibliometric analysis and information science methodologies, the project seeks to empower educators to effectively teach ocean-climate science, with particular emphasis on marginalized communities. Collaboration between Dalhousie University and UQAR will ensure interdisciplinary expertise, community partnerships, and the development of participatory, user-friendly tools.\nTo learn more about different research clusters within TCA and the program’s expected impact, visit the Ocean Frontier Institutes’ website."

    "section": "Methodological Approach",
    "text": "Methodological Approach\nThis descriptive study uses a bibliometric approach to measure engagement with GESAMP publications, and we thus define engagement as references to GESAMP publications in other documents. Specifically, we aim to collect evidence of engagement in three social spheres (research, policy, and news media), each represented by a distinct type of document (peer-reviewed research outputs, policy documents, and news items). We use ‘engagement’ as an all-encompassing term that encompasses all forms and varying degrees of engagement. Forms of engagement can include a mention of GESAMP or of a specific GESAMP publication, or the citation of a GESAMP publication in a research article. In either case, the mention or reference to GESAMP can occur without an in-depth report or use of the information included in the GESAMP publication, which we could qualify as a weak form of engagement; on the other hand, the GESAMP publication may be extensively discussed in the referencing or mentioning piece, which would signal a stronger form of engagement. Our work does not account for such variations in the degree of engagement.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, measuring the use of grey literature is methodologically challenging, primarily due to the lack of data infrastructures specifically designed for this purpose. Similarly, there are relatively standard ways of measuring engagement with scholarly outputs in social media, such as PlumX and Altmetric.com. However, these databases only cover gray literature that contains references to scholarly outputs with DOIs for the purpose of identifying citations to scholarly outputs in grey literature and other documents such as social media, blogs, and news media. These tools, which are widely used in bibliometric research, are not helpful for our purposes; therefore, we had to rely on various manual searches for GESAMP and GESAMP publications in different databases that index the types of documents we are interested in. We describe the data collection process in the following sections."

    "text": "Data collection\n\nGESAMP Reports\nThis study focuses on the analysis of GESAMP publications listed under the Publications page of the GESAMP website, which lists annual reports, thematic reports, proceedings, executive summaries, and histories of GESAMP as part of its Reports and Studies series. We use the generic term “publications” to refer to all these works. We collected information about 120 publications published between 1969 and 2022. Table 1 provides a list of the information collected on GESAMP publications.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Fields used to document GESAMP reports.\n\n\n\nFieldDescriptionIDA unique identifier for the publication. When available, the publication number is the ID.TitleThe title of the publication.AbstractThe abstract for the publication.Publication yearThe year of publication.Publication typeThe type of publication (annual report, thematic report, proceedings, executive summary, history [of GESAMP]).Series nameThe name of the Reports and Studies series as listed on the website.PublisherThe publishing sponsoring organization (IMO, FAO, UNESCO-IOC, UNIDO, WMO, WHO, IAEA, UN, UNEP, ISA, or UNDP).Number of pagesNumber of pages of the publication.Working groupThe working group associated with the publication if available.URLThe URL of the publication from the GESAMP website.Suggested citation formatThe suggested citation format as indicated in the publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations\nWe collected citations to GESAMP publications from the Web of Science (WoS) database, limited to the Science Citation Index (SCI), the Social Science Citations Index (SSCI) and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI). This data was obtained through the Observatoire des sciences et des technologies (OST) at the Université du Québec à Montréal. We searched for the strings “gesamp” and “group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine” in three locations: 1) the cited reference author, 2) the cited reference title, and 3) the cited reference source. It is worth noting that these fields of the Web of Science database contain minimally processed or cleaned data. For example, there were 399 text strings representing GESAMP as the cited reference author. Overall, we retrieved 3,489 distinct reference strings (i.e., references in which GESAMP was mentioned) from a total of 4,713 references across 4,082 distinct publications. For each citing document, we retrieved the publication year and the journal, which allows us to show temporal trends as well as provides insights on the research communities where GESAMP plays a role.\n\n\nPolicy Citations\nTo collect citations to GESAMP publications in policy documents, we used the Overton database, an index of policy documents, guidelines, think tank publications and working papers, with a better coverage than alternative data sources such as Altmetric.com (Dorta-González et al., 2024; Maleki & Holmberg, 2024; Murat et al., 2023). Overton provides citation contexts by indicating where a scholarly output is used in the text of a policy document (when a bibliography section is provided in a policy document, it maps to its DOI) (Szomszor & Adie, 2022). As the referencing practices of grey literature can vary, Overton typically relies on a set of scored features to capture citations. If the overall score exceeds a certain threshold, the citation context is matched to Crossref to capture citations to scholarly literature or the rest of the Overton database for policy documents. Overton’s records include information on the authors of policy documents, source type (e.g., government, think tank), document topics, associated Sustainable Development Goals and the name of the source organization that produced the policy document (e.g., UNESCO, Institute for European Environmental Policy, Government of Canada), which can provide insights into not just how many policy documents cite GESAMP publications, but also who cites them and in what context.\nWe searched for each individual GESAMP publication in Overton using their titles, and we also searched for the term “GESAMP”. We identified most (118 out of 120) GESAMP publications in Overton. Two GESAMP publications – Report of the 32nd Session of GESAMP (#73) and Guidance on Assessment of Sediment Quality (#4) – are unavailable digitally as of December 2024. Thus, they were not included in the Overton database, and we were unable to collect policy citations for these two documents.\nInitially, we identified a total of 2,112 references to GESAMP publications in Overton. This number dropped to 742 after removing references coming from other GESAMP publications. Most of the removed 1,370 GESAMP self-citations were due to the fact that GESAMP reports tend to include a list of past GESAMP reports at the end, which were captured as individual references to each report by Overton, thus largely inflating the numbers. The 742 references included in the analysis occurred in 551 distinct documents produced by 103 organizations.\n\n\nNews Mentions\nNews articles were collected from five databases: Factiva, Eurêka, ProQuest News and Newspapers, NexisUni, and Research Library, chosen for their international scope and the relevance of their available resources. \nFactiva indexes news from over 33,000 sources globally. Emphasizing business and market intelligence data, the available sources include newspapers, trade publications, government publications, and press releases. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspect of marine” retrieved 401 results, exported as headline data in HTML and converted to Comma Separated Values (CSV) files with an R script and manual cleaning, resulting in a final CSV file of 346 exported results.\nThe Eurêka database indexes approximately 2,500 sources covering current events on the local, regional, national, and international levels. “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspect of marine” was searched in all its archives and content. This search retrieved 213 results.\nThe ProQuest News and Newspapers database includes seven newspapers/services: Canadian Newsstream, Global Breaking Newswires, International Newsstream, ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail, ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times with Index, ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Toronto Star, and U.S. Newsstream. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspect of marine” retrieved 93 results.\nThe NexisUni database indexes over 15,000 news, business, and legal source articles focusing on business, political science, and criminal justice. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine” retrieved 189 results. \nThe Research Library database searches multiple interdisciplinary journal sources spanning multiple disciplines and fields. With an international scope, the database comprises a smaller collection of sources, including over 2,300 journals and newspaper sources, as well as recent newswire feeds. A search for “GESAMP” or “group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine” produced 70 results.\nThe combined news mentions dataset contains 911 items with seven metadata fields. After filtering out items with the type “journalArticle” from the Eurêka results (62 items), unique news items can be distinguished by title, publication, and year, leaving 716 results. Note that this curated dataset does not preclude duplicates published in multiple publications or translated works.\nWe subsequently examined the context in which GESAMP was mentioned to identify the specific report that was mentioned, and were able to identify 217 news items mentioning a specific GESAMP publication."

Figure 2 presents the top 25 journals that have cited GESAMP publications the most, with Marine Pollution Bulletin being the journal in which GESAMP publications are the most cited, and by a substantial number. This journal cited GESAMP literature over twice as much as Science of the Total Environment, which has the second highest number of citations to GESAMP work. Environmental Pollution, Ocean & Coastal Management, and Frontiers in Marine Science, comprising the rest of the top 5 journals citing GESAMP publications, indicate a focus on pollution and ocean management. The topic of pollution is also present among the remaining top 20 journals (such as Environmental Science and Pollution Research, Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, and Water Air and Soil Pollution) as are the subjects of toxicology and hazardous materials (Chemosphere, Journal of Hazardous Materials, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, and Aquatic Toxicology), indicating the relevance and utility of GESAMP literature to research published in these journals. Other journals tend to focus on science, technology, ecology, environmental/marine research, and management, whereas topics relating to policy appear less represented. However, several key marine management journals, such as Marine Policy and Coastal Management, show significant interest in GESAMP work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Top journals citing GESAMP publications\n\n\n\nPublication-level references to GESAMP work show that the three most cited GESAMP reports address issues related to plastic pollution in marine environments (#90, #99, #93 – Table 4).

Another report, appearing in the most cited publications of GESAMP, is The Revised GESAMP Hazard Evaluation Procedure for Chemical Substances Carried by Ships (#64), which provides guidelines for the transport of chemical substances in ships and has been updated in recent reports. While the three most cited reports were published in recent years, citations to recent GESAMP work still need some time to accumulate, as the other 12 publications included in the top 15 most cited reports were published more than 12 years ago.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Publication-level citations to GESAMP reports.\n\n\n\nTitleYearCitationsSources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 1) (#90)2,015840Guidelines for the Monitoring and Assessment of Plastic Litter in the Ocean (#99)2,019436Sources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 2) (#93)2,016406The State of the Marine Environment (#39)1,990259The Contributions of Science to Integrated Coastal Management (#61)1,996160Protecting the Oceans from Land-based Activities (#71)2,001133Impact of Oil and Related Chemicals on the Marine Environment (#50)1,993132Land/Sea Boundary Flux of Contaminants: Contributions from Rivers (#32)1,987108Estimates of Oil Entering the Marine Environment from Sea-based Activities (#75)2,00797Opportunistic Settlers and the Problem of the Ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi Invasion in the Black Sea (#58)1,99796A Sea of Troubles (#70)2,00195The Atmospheric Input of Trace Species to the World Ocean (#38)1,98994Proceedings of the GESAMP Workshop on Microplastic particles (#82)2,01089Towards Safe and Effective Use of Chemicals in Coastal Aquaculture (#65)1,99781The Revised GESAMP Hazard Evaluation Procedure for Chemical Substances Carried by Ships (#64)2,00278"

Other top citers include the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the World Meteorological Organization, and UNESCO, which shows strong international confidence in GESAMP literature for their work. Other global bodies that are not solely mandated for environmental protection or have dedicated environmental units include the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

However, one report from the 1980s and three from the 1990s received significant engagement in policy documents. The 1980 report, “Interchange of Pollutants Between the Atmosphere and the Ocean,” for example, received the third-highest amount of policy mentions.

In 2022, in particular, there was a marked rise in news mentions, likely due to increased mainstream attention to the UN’s declared Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) and the ongoing climate emergency (UNESCO, 2017; UNESCO-IOC, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Number of news media mentions of GESAMP publications by year\n\n\n\nThese new works were published by 336 different publications/services, of which the top 25 are shown in Figure 6 below. Three of the top sources are American, indicating that American news services are paying more attention to GESAMP publications. The top news sources are otherwise distributed across global news services, with representation from organizations such as All Africa, South China Morning post, and ForeignAffairs (New Zealand), as well as a large proportion of European news sources: Schiff und Hafen (Germany), La Repubblica (Italy), EUR-Lex, Twitter- Environnement (France), Lloyd’s List (England), and European Union News. Overall, the representation of international news services is less than that of national sources. The World Bank (MENA Report) is also represented in top news sources, as it is among the top policy citers in the GESAMP literature, being the only organization, other than the European Union, to be represented in both policy and news groups. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Top news media publication or service by number of mentions\n\n\n\nReport-level news mentions of GESAMP Reports and Studies are depicted in Table 6. Similar to Table 4 and Table 5, reports #90 and #93 are among the top three reports mentioned in the news. News mentions seem more contemporary, with only two publications dating back to the 1990s and the rest published in the late 2010s. Table 6 also illustrates substantial overlap between news mentions and the two other groups of indicators: 7 of the top 15 reports are common to both policy and the news, while nine are common to citations and the news.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Publication-level news indicators to GESAMP reports.\n\n\n\nTitleYearNews mentionsSources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment (Part 1) (#90)2,01539Sources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment (Part 2) (#93)2,01629A Sea of Troubles (#70)2,00115High Level Review of a Wide Range of Proposed Marine Geoengineering Techniques (#98)2,01911The State of the Marine Environment (#39)1,99010Guidelines for the Monitoring and Assessment of Plastic Litter in the Ocean (#99)2,01910Estimates of Oil Entering the Marine Environment from Sea-based Activities (#75)2,0079Proceedings of the GESAMP Workshop on Microplastic particles (#82)2,0109GESAMP Hazard Evaluation Procedure for Chemicals carried by Ships, 2019 (#102)2,0208Protecting the Oceans from Land-based Activities (#71)2,0017Impact of Oil and Related Chemicals on the Marine Environment (#50)1,9936Global Pollution Trends: Coastal Ecosystem Assessment for the Past Century (#106)2,0205Sea-based sources of marine litter (#108)2,0215"

    "text": "Summary of findings\nThis analysis of literature citing GESAMP publications utilized references from scholarly articles in the Web of Science, policy documents from Overton, and news mentions from Factiva, Eurêka, ProQuest News and Newspapers, NexisUni, and Research Library. All three indicators show a continuous growth in engagement with GESAMP publications over time, with an acceleration occurring around the mid-2010s. This timing aligns with an increased awareness of climate change and ocean pollution. For instance, the UN’s First World Ocean Assessment, released in 2017, exposed the degraded state of the oceans (UNESCO, 2017) and catalyzed national action. Canada, for example, launched a $1.5 billion Oceans Protection Plan (OPP), the largest federal government investment in ocean protection (DFO Maritimes Region OPP Atlantic Hub, 2020). Such efforts around the globe may have spurred research drawing on GESAMP publications. As 2021 marked the beginning of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, GESAMP reports are likely to continue being needed and used.\nGESAMP publication gets cited on average 6.2 times in policy documents indexed in Overton. Without a proper benchmark, it is difficult to determine whether or not this is a low or high number of policy citations. Still, past evidence on policy citations to scholarly literature suggests much lower rates of policy citations for this type of document. For example, research articles related to sharks analyzed in Toupin et al. (2023) paper had, on average, 0.19 policy citations according to Altmetric.com. Dorta-González et al. (2024) analyzed the policy citations of 124,778 articles published in journals containing the term “policy” in their title and found and found an average of 0.6 policy citations according to Altmetric.com and an average of 2.3 policy citations according to Overton. Thus, an average of 6.2 for GESAMP reports signals an above-average use in policy. This was perhaps to be expected as it is one of the intended purposes of GESAMP reports, unlike scholarly articles, which can be relevant for policy but are typically intended first and foremost for scientific audiences. Although it’s mostly UN organizations that draw from GESAMP, the expert group is also referenced in documents produced by the Canadian and United Kingdom governments, as well as by organizations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nSimilarly, we have no suitable benchmark against which to assess whether 5.4 news mentions per GESAMP publication is high or low. Still, this number is about five times higher than the average number of news mentions of papers in Toupin et al. (2023), suggesting a high level of visibility of GESAMP publications in the news.\nIt is also challenging to determine whether the total of 4,713 citations or the average of 39.27 citations per GESAMP publication is high or low without a benchmark of other grey literature or scholarly outputs. The average citations to the set of shark-related papers in Toupin et al. (2023) was lower at 23.9. According to data from OpenAlex (Priem et al., n.d.), papers in Marine Pollution Bulletin have received an average of 35.6 times1. These numbers suggest that GESAMP publications play an important role not only in policymaking but also in science published in a range of journals, such as Marine Pollution Bulletin, Science of the Total Environment, and Environmental Pollution.\n1 It should be noted that because of its its more extensive coverage, OpenAlex citation counts are likely to be higher than citation counts obtained from the Web of Science, which we used for this study.Some of the most frequently cited and mentioned GESAMP publications have focused on plastic pollution in the ocean, a topic of growing interest in recent years. These reports were highly discussed in the news media upon publication. We also observe that GESAMP’s most frequently mentioned work in policy documents and news media was published in recent years, a stark contrast to citations. Some possible explanations include a faster accumulation of use in the news and policy compared to citations, which take more time to accumulate, or heightened visibility and accessibility of grey literature in the digital era."

    "text": "Contributions of our study\nOur findings make an empirical contribution to the literature on boundary-spanning organizations and their role in bridging the gap betweenoffer a valuable empirical contribution to the literature on boundary-spanning organizations and their role in bridging science and policy. By examining the dissemination and uptake of GESAMP reports across scholarly, policy, and media domains, it reinforces the notion that boundary organizations are not only conduits of information but active agents in shaping environmental discourse and decision-making. Kettle et al. (2017) and Leith et al. (2016) highlight the importance of boundary organizations, and our analysis of GESAMP’s increasing visibility illustrates how sustained engagement and institutional support can enhance the reach and influence of scientific advisory bodies. Bednarek et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of trust, credibility, and strategic communication in boundary-spanning work. Our findings echo these insights by showing how GESAMP’s outputs gain traction among diverse stakeholders. Cvitanovic et al. (2014);Cvitanovic et al. (2015); Cvitanovic et al. (2016) highlight the challenges of knowledge exchange in marine resource management. Our study contributes to demonstrating how grey literature, when strategically produced and disseminated, can support adaptive governance and evidence-based decision-making, particularly in ocean management. Ultimately, our study provides a compelling case for investing in boundary-spanning mechanisms that amplify the societal value of environmental science.\nOur study also constitutes a methodological contribution to research aimed at measuring the impact of gray literature and the organizations that produce it. Indeed, capturing the use of grey literature is challenging, and while our process relied largely on manual searches and verifications, which makes it difficult to scale up, it may nonetheless provide guidance for others who wish to replicate or expand on our process to measure the impact of grey literature. Finally, a practical implication of our work and the process it illustrates is the potential for GESAMP and similar organizations to evaluate the impact of their contributions, and more importantly, to communicate it to stakeholders and other organizations on which they may depend for legitimacy or funding.\nThis study’s approach possesses several limitations. A search for GESAMP publications was conducted across databases by searching for “gesamp” and its full name. Reports were not searched for at an individual level, which may have limited the comprehensiveness of the retrieved results from databases. As extensive as the coverage of our data sources may be this report underestimates the total engagement of GESAMP literature."

    "text": "Concluding remarks\nThis study underscores the growing relevance and reach of grey literature produced by environmental scientific advisory bodies, using GESAMP as a compelling case study. Despite the inherent challenges in tracking and quantifying the impact of non-indexed outputs, our multi-source approach reveals a clear upward trajectory in the visibility and use of GESAMP reports across scholarly, policy, and media landscapes. The increasing citation of these reports in academic literature—particularly in fields related to marine pollution and ocean governance—demonstrates their value in shaping scientific discourse. Moreover, the engagement from national and regional environmental organizations highlights the broader impact of GESAMP’s work beyond its sponsoring institutions.\nThese findings underscore the importance of developing robust mechanisms to monitor and assess the impact of grey literature, particularly as it continues to inform critical environmental decision-making. As global challenges intensify, the ability of expert groups like GESAMP to synthesize knowledge and disseminate it effectively to diverse audiences will remain essential. Future research should explore additional platforms and metrics to capture the nuanced pathways through which such reports contribute to policy development, public awareness, and scientific progress. Strengthening the visibility and traceability of grey literature will ultimately enhance its utility and legitimacy in the environmental knowledge ecosystem."
