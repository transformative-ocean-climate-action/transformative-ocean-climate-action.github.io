 The United Nations (UN) proclamation of 2021-2030 as a Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable 
Development recognizes the interrelationship between climate change and the Earth’s oceans. 
Reversing the decline of ocean health and taking meaningful action on climate change requires 
empowering all stakeholders and rightsholders – including youth – to help develop and implement 
adaptative solutions. Our cluster approaches this issue from an informational justice perspective, 
emphasizing the right by all to access information and knowledge, have equal opportunity to directly 
participate in the production and dissemination of information and knowledge, and have their identities 
and culture be recognized, respected, and fairly represented in the informational world. Guided by this 
framework, our research addresses the fundamental question: How can we improve knowledge 
production, exchange, and use among diverse actors to build an understanding of ocean and climate 
change that enables societal mobilization towards a sustainable future?
